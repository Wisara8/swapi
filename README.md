# Star Wars API App

This project was created as a demonstration of me using React hooks and effects. Upon loading it will fetch movie data from the swapi.dev website and display the first 6 movies. You can select a film to get its individual data and from there pick a character to see their stats. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
